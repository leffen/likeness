# likeness
Likeness might one day become a photo-finding and archiving tool.

This is a project to learn more Go and also a re-implementation of some Python scripts I had up and running a few years ago.

I also am playing with this idea in Swift in [likeness-swift](https://github.com/werkshy/likeness-swift).
